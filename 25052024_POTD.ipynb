Each stack of books has some nonzero height arr[i] equal to the number of books on that stack ( considering all the books are identical and each book has a height of 1 unit ). In one move, you can select any number of consecutive stacks of books such that the height of each selected stack of books arr[i] <= k. Once such a sequence of stacks is chosen, You can collect any number of books from the chosen sequence of stacks.\n",
