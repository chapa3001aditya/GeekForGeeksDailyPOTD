    "You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if X and Y are the repeating numbers, and X's second appearance comes before second appearance of Y, then the order should be (X, Y).\n",

    "In the given array, 1 and 3 are repeated two times and as 1's second appearance occurs before 2's second appearance, so the output should be 1 3.\n",

    "The task is to complete the function repeatedElements() which takes an integer array arr[] and an integer n as inputs (the size of the array is n + 2 and elements are in the range [1, n]) and finds the two repeated elements in the array and return them in an array.\n",
